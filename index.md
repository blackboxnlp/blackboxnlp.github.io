## Invited Speakers
### Zhijing Jin
<p><img src="img/Zhijing.png" width="150px" height="140px"></p>

_Zhijing Jin is a Ph.D. at Max Planck Institute & ETH. Her research focuses on socially responsible NLP via causal and moral principles. Specifically, she works on expanding the impact of NLP by promoting NLP for social good, and developing CausalNLP to improve robustness, fairness, and interpretability of NLP models, as well as analyze the causes of social problems._

**Causal NLP: A Path towards Opening the Black Box of NLP**<br>
> Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in many tasks. However, the opaque nature of these NLP models often obscures the reasons behind their successes and unexpected failures. To interpret LLMs, early studies have identified correlations between embeddings and linguistic properties. In this talk, I will provide an overview of how causal analysis is being utilized in interpretability research for LLMs, highlighting its unique contributions to the field, as well as the open challenges. I will introduce the role of causality in two branches of interpretability: for behavioral studies of LLMs, I propose a causal framework that reformulates the robustness problem as a difference in the causal decision-making processes of humans versus those of the model; to understand the inner workings of LLMs, I will discuss how causal intervention and causal mediation analysis aid in unraveling the mechanisms of reasoning in LLMs, and how different mechanisms interact. I believe Causal NLP opens a unique pathway towards paving the way for more transparent, reliable, and responsible AI systems.


### Antoine Bosselut
<p><img src="img/Antoine.jpg" width="150px" height="150px"></p>

_Antoine Bosselut is an assistant professor in the School of Computer and Communication Sciences at the Ã‰cole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©ral de Lausanne (EPFL). He was a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University and a Young Investigator at the Allen Institute for AI (AI2). He completed his PhD at the University of Washington and was a student researcher at Microsoft Research. His research interests are in building systems that mix knowledge and language representations to solve problems in NLP, specializing in commonsense representation and reasoning._

**From Mechanistic Interpretability to Mechanistic Reasoning**
> Pretrained language models (LMs) encode implicit representations of knowledge in their parameters. Despite this observation, our best methods for interpreting these representations yield few actionable insights on how to manipulate this parameter space for downstream benefit. In this talk, I will present work on methods that simulate machine reasoning by localizing and modifying parametric knowledge representations. First, I will present a method for discovering knowledge-critical subnetworks within pretrained language models, and show that these sparse computational subgraphs are responsible for the modelâ€™s ability to encode specific pieces of knowledge. Then, I will present a new reasoning algorithm, RECKONING, a bi-level optimisation procedure that dynamically encodes and reasons over new knowledge at test-time using the modelâ€™s existing learned knowledge representations as a scratchpad. Finally, I will discuss next steps and challenges in using internal model mechanisms for reasoning.

## Workshop description

Many recent performance improvements in NLP have come at the cost of understanding of the systems. How do we assess what representations and computations models learn? How do we formalize desirable properties of interpretable models, and measure the extent to which existing models achieve them? How can we build models that better encode these properties? What can new or existing tools tell us about these systemsâ€™ inductive biases?

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers focused on interpreting and explaining NLP models by taking inspiration from fields such as machine learning, psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience. We hope the workshop will serve as an interdisciplinary meetup that allows for cross-collaboration.

The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:
- Explanation methods such as saliency, attribution, free-text explanations, or explanations with structured properties.
- Mechanistic interpretability, reverse engineering approaches to understanding particular properties of neural models.
- Probing methods for testing whether models have acquired or represent certain linguistic properties.
- Applying analysis techniques from other disciplines (e.g., neuroscience or computer vision).
- Examining model performance on simplified or formal languages.
- Proposing modifications to neural architectures that increase their interpretability.
- Open-source tools for analysis, visualization, or explanation.
- Evaluation of explanation methods: how do we know the explanation is faithful to the model?
- Opinion pieces about the state of explainable NLP.

Feel free to reach out to the organizers at the email below if you are not sure whether a specific topic is well-suited for submission.

## Call for Papers
We will accept submissions through Softconf at: [https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2023/blackboxnlp2023/](https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2023/blackboxnlp2023/). All submissions should use the EMNLP 2023 [template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/instructions-for-emnlp-2023-proceedings/scyjxmtnrskr) and formatting requirements specified by [ACL](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html). Archival paper must be fully anonymized. Submissions of both types can be made through [Softconf](https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2023/blackboxnlp2023/).


### Submission Types
- **Archival papers** of up to 8 pages + references. These are papers reporting on completed, original and unpublished research. An optional appendix may appear after the references in the same pdf file. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop and will be published in the workshop proceedings of the ACL Anthology, meaning they cannot be published elsewhere. They should report on obtained results rather than intended work. Broader Impacts/Ethics and Limitations sections are optional and can be included on a 9th page.
- **Non-archival extended abstracts** of 2 pages + references. These may report on work in progress or may be cross-submissions of work that has already appeared (or is scheduled to appear) in another venue in 2022-2023. Abstract titles will be posted on the workshop website but will not be included in the proceedings. The selection will not be based on a double-blind review and thus submissions of this type need not be anonymized. 

Accepted submissions for both tracks will be presented at the workshop: most as posters, some as oral presentations (determined by the program committee).


### Dual Submissions and Preprints
Dual submissions **are** allowed for the archival track, but please check the dual submissions policy for the other venue that you are dual-submitting to. Papers posted to preprint servers such as arXiv can be submitted without any restrictions on when they were posted.

### Camera-ready information
Authors of accepted archival papers should upload the final version of their paper to the submission system by the camera-ready deadline. Authors may use **one extra page** to address reviewer comments, for a total of nine pages + references. Broader Impacts/Ethics and Limitations sections are optional and can be included on a 10th page.
